Grimm paper notes

benefits to understanding operator gaze:
	-provides information about the importance of different features of an object to completing a task

humans rarely look at their own hands when grasping
	-means we need to improve simulator interfaces by providing the correct visual cues of the object and its surroundings

Contributions:
	-identified a complex fixation pattern for complex objects
	-identified visual cues used to compensate for lack of proprioception
	-use these cues to create better camera viewpoints

Problems with "learning from demonstration"
	-too time intensive
	-humans overestimate grasps that look "human"

Where people look during grasps with their own hands
	-mixture of tracking the following:
		*object's center of mass
		*top of object
		*where the forefinger will make contact with the object

Physical study method
	-Participants performed manipulation tasks with own hand and physically manipulating a robotic arm
	-eye gaze was tracked and they were asked to "think aloud" throughout
	-camera viewpoints for grasp evaluation developed from this experiment were validated by an online survey
